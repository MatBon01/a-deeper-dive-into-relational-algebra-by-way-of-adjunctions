Conclusions and Future Work
The project's conclusions should summarise the key insights that have been gained, be they positive or negative. For example, "The use of overloading in C++ provides a very elegant mechanism for transparent parallelisation of sequential programs", or "The overheads of linear-time n-body algorithms makes them computationally less efficient than O(n log n) algorithms for systems with less than 100000 particles". Avoid tedious personal reflections like "I learned a lot about C++ programming...". It is common to finish the report by listing ways in which the project can be taken further. This might, for example, be a plan for doing the project better if you could do a re-run, turning the project deliverables into a more polished end product, or extending the project into a programme for an MPhil or PhD.
