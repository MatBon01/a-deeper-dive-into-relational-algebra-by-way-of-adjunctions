\chapter{Introduction}
\begin{comment}
The introduction should summarise the subject area, the specific problem you are addressing, including key ideas for their solution, together with a summary of the project's main contributions. When detailing the contributions it is helpful to provide forward references to the section(s) of the report that provide the relevant technical details. The introduction should be aimed at an informed, but otherwise non-expert, reader. A good tip is to assume that all your assessors will read the abstract and introduction, whereas the more detailed technical sections may only be read by your first and second markers - it's therefore really important to get it right.
