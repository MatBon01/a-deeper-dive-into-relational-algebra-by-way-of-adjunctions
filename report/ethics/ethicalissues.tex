What are the wider ethical, legal, professional and societal issues surrounding your project and the accompanying research? You should use the ethics checklist as the basis for this discussion.

The project itself (in its early stages) does not have a novel ideal as a useable output and thus is very neutral in its ethical impact. Instead it has the ability to recommend or withold recommendation of an earlier approach to database optimisations via implementation and benchmarking results, and in its final stages may recommend further optimisations and so the more interesting ethical discussion is around the ethics of database optimisations.

Databases are a necessity for most modern applications. Furthermore, database optimisations are especially important for large, scaling products or services. This means that improving this area of computer science has a very undiscriminated effect on the type of software products that can make use of it. Of course, just as any private company could make use of the newer more efficient techniques, any military hosting a database could too. It is also worth noting the implementation is in a functional programming language, a rising paradigm \todo{cite} typically associated with reliability \todo{add another quality} \todo{Add citation for this} which aligns very well with the real-time and safety critical nature of military applications. \todo{cite that these are important for military applications}

In fact, it could be argued that any findings could benefit society at large in an environmental standpoint. The heart of the project is in database optimisations, which in turn reduce the amount of time required to process queries. \todo{research this} One could extrapolate, that without much of an increased processing complexity and resource consumption, this would lead to a reduction in the energy required for these database queries. Given how commonplace database queries are \todo{find stats} this could have a nontrivial impact.
