What are the wider ethical, legal, professional and societal issues surrounding your project and the accompanying research? You should use the ethics checklist as the basis for this discussion.

The project itself (in its early stages) does not have a novel ideal as a useable output and thus is very neutral in its ethical impact. Instead it has the ability to recommend or withold recommendation of an earlier approach to database optimisations via implementation and benchmarking results, and in its final stages may recommend further optimisations and so the more interesting ethical discussion is around the ethics of database optimisations.

\todo{Note on whether I need permission from the person's idea for the implementation}

Databases are a necessity for most modern applications. Furthermore, database optimisations are especially important for large, scaling products or services. This means that improving this area of computer science has a very undiscriminated effect on the type of software products that can make use of it. Of course, just as any private company could make use of the newer more efficient techniques, any military hosting a database could too. It is also worth noting the implementation is in a functional programming language, a rising paradigm \todo{cite} typically associated with reliability \todo{add another quality} \todo{Add citation for this} which aligns very well with the real-time and safety critical nature of military applications. \todo{cite that these are important for military applications}
