\chapter{Evaluation}
\begin{comment}
Be warned that many projects fall down through poor evaluation. Simply building a system and documenting its design and functionality is not enough to gain top marks. It is extremely important that you evaluate what you have done both in absolute terms and in comparison with the state of the art. This might involve quantitative evaluation, for example based on numerical results, performance etc. or something more qualitative such as expressibility, functionality, ease-of-use etc., possible with respect to a target user base. The evaluation, often coupled with a discussion of future work (see below), should make clear the strengths and weaknesses of what you have done. It is important to understand that there is no such thing as a perfect project. Even the very best pieces of work have their limitations, so you are expected to provide a proper critical appraisal.
