\section{Synthetic database creation}
This section evaluates the design decisions and outcomes in creating a synthetic
database generator as outlined in \fref{sec:benchmark:syntheticdatabase}. This
project introduced a framework to generate database to fit a custom schema. The
benefits of synthetic data are vast and include the ability to define schemas
that are specialised in benchmarking and readability while controlling frequency
of values and other important properties.
