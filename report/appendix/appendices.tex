The appendices contain information which is peripheral to the main body of the report. Information typically included are things like parts of the code, tables, proofs, test cases or any other material which would break up the theme of the text if it appeared in the main body of the text. 

Label these as Appendix A, Appendix B etc and refer to the appropriate appendix from the main body of the report.
