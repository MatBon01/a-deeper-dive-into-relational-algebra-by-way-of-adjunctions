User Guide Appendix
It is not common to provide a user guide in the report. This can be included in the repo you submit for the software archive.

If you do feel that you should supply a user guide (e.g. for projects which result in a new piece of software), you might choose to provide a user guide providing easily understood instructions on how to use it.

A particularly useful approach is to treat the user guide as a walk-through of a typical session, or set of sessions, which collectively display all the features of your system.

Technical details of how the package works should be in the body of the report. Keep this concise and simple.

The use of diagrams illustrating the package in action prove particularly helpful.
