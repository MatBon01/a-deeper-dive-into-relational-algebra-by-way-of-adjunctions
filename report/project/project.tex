The central part of the report usually consists of three or four chapters detailing the technical work undertaken during the project. The structure of these chapters is highly project dependent. They can reflect the chronological development of the project, e.g. requirements, design, implementation, experimentation, optimisation, evaluation etc. although this is not always the best approach. However you choose to structure this part of the report, you should make it clear how you arrived at your chosen approach in preference to the other alternatives documented in the background. If you have built a new piece of software you should describe and justify your design and details any interesting problems with, or features of, your implementation. Integration and testing are also important to discuss in some cases. You need to discuss the content of these sections thoroughly with your supervisor.
