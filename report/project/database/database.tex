\chapter{Database implementation}\label{chap:database}
This chapter will describe the implementation of the database system outlined in
\relalg{}. The aims of the chapter are to highlight key implementations of the
algorithms of the paper. The purpose of implementing the structures in the paper
are to benchmark and so a high level pragmatic approach is taken in order to
create a working system that can easily be benchmarked.

The structure of the database management system implemented in this
project is a library based off of the code in
\relalg{}~\cite{RelationalAlgebraByWayOfAdjunctions} especially the appendix.
This chapter describes the code needed to create a fully functioning
system as well as highlights my contributions.
