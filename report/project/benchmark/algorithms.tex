\section{Algorithms to benchmark}
In this section we present an overview of the three different algorithms we will
be comparing in this benchmark. The paper \relalg{} presents a solution for
equijoin (and arbitrary selections followed by joins) query optimisation using
structures in Haskell, the algorithms compared will comprise of two alternative
``dummy'' solutions which may be seen as a simple implementation without the
findings of the paper, and a solution using an indexed structure as described
in the paper.
