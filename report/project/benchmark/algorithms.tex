\section{Algorithms to benchmark}
In this section we present an overview of the three different algorithms we will
be comparing in this benchmark. The paper \relalg{} presents a solution for
equijoin (and arbitrary selections followed by joins) query optimisation using
structures in Haskell, the algorithms compared will comprise of two alternative
``dummy'' solutions which may be seen as a simple implementation without the
findings of the paper, and a solution using an indexed structure as described
in the paper.

The first algorithm to be presented has been dubbed \modularproduct{}. This name
highlights the modular nature of the equijoin query (each part is expressesd in
discrete steps) while telling us that we are using the non-indexed approach of taking the
cartesian product. The \modularproduct{} class of algorithms use the
\lstinline[language=Haskell]{productEquijoin} funciton.
