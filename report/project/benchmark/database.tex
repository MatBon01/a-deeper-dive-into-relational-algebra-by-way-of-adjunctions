\section{Synthetic database creation}\label{sec:benchmark:database}
Synthetic databases are critical to running a customisable and repeatable
benchmark. Those who wish to benchmark a database can use custom synthetic
databases in order to specify a large amount of unknowns in the data of the
benchmarks run. Examples of such parameters range from both the size of the
database as a whole to on a tuple level by carefully choosing attribute domains.
Attribute domains can also help give a heuristic control to resource load while
processing queries by determining how difficult it is to computer an answer (for
instance using the equality of strings). Furthermore, when designed correctly synthetic
databases can provide a readable method to easily specify wanted properties of
queries via explicit and easy to calculate selectivity factors in selections and
joins.
