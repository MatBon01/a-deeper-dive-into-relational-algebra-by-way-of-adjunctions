\subsection{Pointed sets}
This section describes the types that declare instances of the
\texttt{PointedSet} type class.

For testing purposes, the most useful type to declare an instance of
\texttt{PointedSet} was the \texttt{Maybe} type. This fits very well as it can
easily raise any existing type to one with a distinguished element (null),
namely \texttt{Nothing}.
