\section{Results}
The results clearly show the expected pattern. In most cases indexed equijoin
shows a clear time advantage over both other methods completely independent to
the query asked. The justification for this is clearly the localised Cartesian
products. Methods that consider all possible pairs must select through $n^2$
pairs whereas in order to index only $2n$ searches are required and the
Cartesian product is localised to strictly only the required pairs. This is a
large advantage for any reasonable number of tuples.
