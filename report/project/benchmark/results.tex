\section{Results}\label{sec:benchmark:results}
The results clearly show the expected pattern. In most cases indexed equijoin
shows a clear time advantage over both other methods completely independent of
the query asked. The justification for this is clearly the localised Cartesian
products. Methods that consider all possible pairs must select through $n^2$
pairs whereas in order to index only $2n$ searches are required and the
Cartesian product is localised to strictly only the required pairs. This is a
large advantage for any reasonable number of tuples. This can be seen for tuple
counts of 1000, 5000, and 10000 where indexed join performs significantly better.
Considering the query `join onePercent and onePercent' when using indexed
equijoin over product equijoin the mean time to complete each query is over 70\% faster
with both 5000 and 10000 tuples recording a mean time above 90\% faster. This
is very significant and the table of results can be found in
\fref{tab:percentage-change-of-means-join-onePercent-and-onePercent}. Similarly, compared to the comprehension
equijoin the mean time to complete is above 40\% faster for 1000 tuples which is
admittedly smaller than expected but for 5000 and 10000 tuples there are
improvements of well over 80\%. A visual representation of the results can be
found in \fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-1000},
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-5000},
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-10000} for 1000, 5000, and 10000 tuples
respectively when considering the standard queries that join attributes to
\relationAttribute{onePercent}.

The results for the join queries `join twentyPercent and onePercent' and `join
evenOnePercent and oddOnePercent' are very similar to the above
where indexed equijoin far outperforms the alternatives; tables comparing
results with 1000, 5000, and 10000 tuples can be found in
\fref{tab:percentage-change-of-means-join-evenOnePercent-and-oddOnePercent} and
\fref{tab:percentage-change-of-means-join-twentyPercent-and-onePercent}. Interestingly,
the gains for `join evenOnePercent and oddOnePercent' are significantly larger
than the other queries and grow to be more extreme as tuple count increases; it
is in these queries that we also find such an extreme improvement over
comprehension equijoin. As the query is an edge case I feel it clearly
demonstrates the strength of the indexed equijoin method not participating in as
much unnecessary work. Although indexed equijoin must still search all tuples in
order to index them, no Cartesian products are performed at all. It is clear why
this is such an advantage over the product equijoin, however, comprehensions do
not perform Cartesian products either. I believe that the advantage could come
from poor optimisation of such an unlikely edge case by GHC or an idea of
balancedness between both relations, an idea that will be explored later.
Visualisations of the results can be found in
\fref{fig:non-standard-1000}, \fref{fig:non-standard-5000} and
\fref{fig:non-standard-10000} for 1000, 5000, and 10000 tuples respectively.

similar percentage improvement.}

The results for the queries `join onePercent and twentyPercent' and `join
twentyPercent and onePercent' when compared together are surprising. A visual
representation of each function's performance in mean time to complete these
queries when applied to relations with 5000 tuples can be found in 
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-twentyPercent-flipped-5000}. As mentioned before,
I thought that the lack of symmetry in the computation of the function would
play a larger effect than can be observed. It is clear from the graph that this
was not the case to a significant proportion. Most surprisingly, I thought that,
despite not being too drastic, the difference would be most notable in the
comprehension equijoin function; though from further inspection there does not
seem to be any particular difference between all functions. It is clear that the
product equijoin would have the largest indifference to the order of operations
as it was designed to be modular and not take circumstance into much
consideration, in fact the statistics support this and in the case with 5000
tuples the mean time to complete `join twentyPercent and onePercent' was only
2\% faster than the time to compute the contrary. Surprisingly, however, the
indexed equijoin function had the largest relative decrease in order of operands
with a 9\% decrease, closely followed by the expected victor comprehension
equijoin with 8\%. This seems to be an act of chance, as varying the tuple count
(and tables generated with each tuple count) has a drastic effect on the
percentage change experienced by the indexed equijoin. The indexed equijoin
actually has an increase in mean time for tuple counts of 6000, 7000, 8000 and
9000 whereas the comprehension equijoin has a similar order of decrease at all
counts (as does the product equijoin). This suggests that the pattern of
optimisation in the comprehension equijoin may be there but, in my opinion, the
results are not significant and more research will need to be done in this area
as well as a more thorough analysis on the lower levels of the Haskell compiler.

    \caption{A comparison of the mean time to complete the queries `join
    onePercent and twentyPercent' and `join twentyPercent and onePercent'. The
results are surprising in that the order of operands does not have as
significant of an effect as expected, especially in the case of the
comprehension equijoin.}
    \label{fig:benchmark:onePercent-twentyPercent-flipped-5000}
\end{figure}

As is typical with many solutions that rely on indexing the solution is not
always optimal, especially in the case of a low tuple count. Generating the
indexed structure takes a significant initial overhead and therefore is not
optimal for `small' tasks. In fact, for almost all queries it took 500 tuples
for there to be any benefit over the worst performing function, product
equijoin. Moreover, it took a tuple count of between 750 and 1000 to become
beneficial over comprehension equijoin. The `slow startup' time of the indexed
equijoin in comparison to the other functions can be observed in
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-fiftyPercent-tuples}, 
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-twentyPercent-tuples},
\fref{fig:benchmark:twentyPercent-onePercent-tuples},
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-onePercent-tuples}
and \fref{fig:benchmark:evenOnePercent-oddOnePercent-tuples}.

However, beyond the initial overhead the
function's average mean time grows at a comparatively very slow rate independent
of the type of query tested against. As can be clearly seen in
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-twentyPercent-tuples} the growth of the mean time
for the indexed equijoin is much slower. It is clear that this is due to the
local Cartesian products that are performed. Both other solutions consider $n^2$
pairs when conducting the equijoin and therefore the time taken to complete the
equijoin clearly grows at a quadratic rate with respect to the number of tuples
in the relation. On the other hand, the indexed equijoin indexes the relation in
$\mathrm{O}(n)$ time and then conducts local Cartesian products with the smaller
groups. For further evidence of the significance that the local Cartesian
products have we will conduct a short analysis on the growth of the mean time on
all queries. It is clear that the growth of the indexed equijoin for the query
`join twentyPercent and onePercent' (found in
\fref{fig:benchmark:twentyPercent-onePercent-tuples}) is remarkably similar to the growth
in the query `join onePercent and twentyPercent' (found in
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-twentyPercent-tuples}). I believe this is not
just down to the lack of strong significance in order of operands as shown
above, but rather the size of the local Cartesian products. The attribute
\relationAttribute{twentyPercent} has 5 different values that partition the
space into roughly 5 groups with 20\%. This equates to 5 medium sized Cartesian
products (the operation that contains the largest algorithmic complexity). If
you compare the graphs for the query `join onePercent and fiftyPercent' (in
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-fiftyPercent-tuples}) you will see that the slope
of the line for comprehension equijoin is comparatively steep. As a reminder,
the query `join onePercent and fiftyPercent' only has two local Cartesian
products, each holding 50\% of the second relation. This is a clear suggestion
as to why it grows more unfavourably than the other queries: the local Cartesian
product, the main contributor to computational complexity, is fed much larger
tuples. Expectedly, the query `join onePercent and onePercent' (as seen in
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-onePercent-tuples}) has a much more shallow slope
than `join onePercent and twentyPercent' due to having 100 local Cartesian
products all with only 1\% of the second relation; the additive effect of
having so many products is negligible compared to the multiplicative effect of
few large products. Taking this to an extreme, we can see that the query `join
evenOnePercent and oddOnePercent' (in
\fref{fig:benchmark:evenOnePercent-oddOnePercent-tuples}) has no slope at all.
The domains of the attributes in question are mutually exclusive and therefore
the result is an empty relation. The result of this are no local Cartesian
products which when noted next to the almost non-existent gradient of mean time
gives me confidence that the local Cartesian products are the main contributor
to growth in mean time over tuple count. A graph comparing the slopes of the
indexed equijoin function for the queries discussed can be found in
\fref{fig:benchmark:indexed-equijoin-query-comparison}. It is worth noting that the other
functions seem to grow in the same way irrespective of the query selectivity;
this is due to the algorithmic need to compare all $n^2$ possible pairs. If
programmed in a pragmatic way for a viable query engine it is likely these
algorithms would be supplemented with a query optimiser that would conduct a
selection before the join to ensure that products are kept from being
unnecessarily large or detect the empty intersection in the domains of
\relationAttribute{evenOnePercent} and \relationAttribute{oddOnePercent}.
