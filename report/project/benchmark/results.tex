\section{Results}
The results clearly show the expected pattern. In most cases indexed equijoin
shows a clear time advantage over both other methods completely independent to
the query asked. The justification for this is clearly the localised Cartesian
products. Methods that consider all possible pairs must select through $n^2$
pairs whereas in order to index only $2n$ searches are required and the
Cartesian product is localised to strictly only the required pairs. This is a
large advantage for any reasonable number of tuples. This can be seen for tuple
counts of 1000, 5000 and 10000 where indexed join performs significantly better.
Considering the query `join onePercent and onePercent' when using indexed
equijoin over product equijoin the mean time to complete each query is over 70\% faster
with both 5000 and 10000 tuples recording a mean time above 90\% faster. This
is very significant and the table of results can be found in
\fref{tab:percentage-change-of-means-join-onePercent-and-onePercent}. Similarly, compared to the comprehension
equijoin the mean time to complete is above 40\% faster for 1000 tuples which is
admittedly smaller than expected but for 5000 and 10000 tuples there are
improvements of well over 80\%. A visual representation of the results can be
found in \fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-1000},
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-5000},
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-10000} for 1000, 5000 and 10000 tuples
respectively when considering the standard queries that join attributes to
\relationAttribute{onePercent}.

The results for the join queries `join twentyPercent and onePercent' and `join
evenOnePercent and oddOnePercent' are very similar to the above
where indexed equijoin far outperforms the alternatives; tables comparing
results with 1000, 5000 and 10000 tuples can be found in
\fref{tab:percentage-change-of-means-join-evenOnePercent-and-oddOnePercent} and
\fref{tab:percentage-change-of-means-join-twentyPercent-and-onePercent}. Interestingly,
the gains for 'join evenOnePercent and oddOnePercent' are significantly larger
than the other queries and grow to be more extreme as tuple count increases; it
is in these queries that we also find such an extreme improvement over
comprehension equijoin. As the query is an edge case I feel it clearly
demonstrates the strength of the indexed equijoin method not participating in as
much unnecessary work. Although indexed equijoin must still search all tuples in
order to index them, no Cartesian products are performed at all. It is clear why
this is such an advantage over the product equijoin, however comprehensions do
not perform Cartesian products either. I believe that the advantage could come
from poor optimisation of such an unlikely edge case by GHC or an idea of
balancedness between both relations, an idea that will be explored later.
Visualisations of the results can be found in
\fref{fig:non-standard-1000}, \fref{fig:non-standard-5000} and
\fref{fig:non-standard-10000} for 1000, 5000 and 10000 tuples respectively.
