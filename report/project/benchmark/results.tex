\section{Results}
The results clearly show the expected pattern. In most cases indexed equijoin
shows a clear time advantage over both other methods completely independent to
the query asked. The justification for this is clearly the localised Cartesian
products. Methods that consider all possible pairs must select through $n^2$
pairs whereas in order to index only $2n$ searches are required and the
Cartesian product is localised to strictly only the required pairs. This is a
large advantage for any reasonable number of tuples. This can be seen for tuple
counts of 1000, 5000 and 10000 where indexed join performs significantly better.
Considering the query `join onePercent and onePercent' when using indexed
equijoin over product equijoin the mean time to complete each query is over 70\% faster
with both 5000 and 10000 tuples recording a mean time above 90\% faster. This
is very significant and the table of results can be found in
\fref{tab:percentage-change-of-means-join-onePercent-and-onePercent}. Similarly, compared to the comprehension
equijoin the mean time to complete is above 40\% faster for 1000 tuples which is
admittedly smaller than expected but for 5000 and 10000 tuples there are
improvements of well over 80\%. A visual representation of the results can be
found in \fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-1000},
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-5000},
\fref{fig:benchmark:onePercent-10000} for 1000, 5000 and 10000 tuples
respectively when considering the standard queries that join attributes to
\relationAttribute{onePercent}.
