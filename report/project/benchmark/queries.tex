\section{Queries}
This section will present the queries explored during the benchmarking of the
database system. Along with each query an analysis of its purpose will also be
presented. The benchmark will run each query a number of times against each of
the functions presented in \fref{sec:benchmark:functions} and the mean results
will be analysed and compared during the rest of this chapter.

The queries presented all have a similar structure in how they are presented and
form. They are all equijoins, as equijoins are the focus of this project and a
good way to judge the optimisation of a join followed by a select. Each join
will be given a name of the form ``join \relationAttribute{x} and
\relationAttribute{y}'' where \relationAttribute{x} and \relationAttribute{y}
are the names of attributes that the equijoin is performed on; the special font
for attributes will be dropped in the query names. It is worth noting that
``join \relationAttribute{x} and \relationAttribute{y}'' is not the same as
``join \relationAttribute{y} and \relationAttribute{x}'' as the order that the
attributes appear in the name is the order they are entered into the function
and this may be significant computationally.
