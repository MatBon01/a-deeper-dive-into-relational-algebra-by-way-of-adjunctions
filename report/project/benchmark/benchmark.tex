\chapter{Benchmark}
In order to establish a judgement on the claimed improvements of the query
optimisation a benchmark is design, conducted and presented for this project.

The purpose of this chapter is two-fold. After establishing the set of
technologies we will benchmark in \fref{chap:database} we present the benchmarks
conducted on the database in \fref{sec:results} as well as explaining the implementation details of the tools
designed to help conduct the benchmark in \fref{sec:benchmark:database} and
\fref{sec:benchmark:workflow}.
