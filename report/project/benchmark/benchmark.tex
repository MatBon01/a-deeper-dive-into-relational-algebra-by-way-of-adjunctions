\chapter{Benchmark}
In order to evaluate the performance of the alternative equijoin algorithm a
benchmark must be designed. We present the benchmark, methodology and results in
this chapter.

The purpose of this chapter is two-fold. After establishing the set of
technologies we will benchmark in \fref{chap:database} we present the benchmarks
conducted on the database in \fref{sec:benchmark:results} as well as explaining the implementation details of the tools
designed to help conduct the benchmark in \fref{sec:benchmark:database} and
\fref{sec:benchmark:workflow}.
