\section{Experiment details}\label{sec:benchmark:experiment}
This section will briefly describe the specifics about the experiment so that
reproducibly is more likely and the results are placed within their context.

The benchmark uses the \verb|Criterion| library to collect all data (version
1.6.2.0). Sampling was left to default behaviour of the library and results were
read directly without further processing. Results were read using Python's
\verb|pandas| library (version 1.5.3) and may be the source of very minor floating point
rounding errors as has been observed in extremely small orders.

The benchmark was run on a ZSH shell environment running on an iTerm2 terminal
emulator. The hardware running the benchmarks was a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip.
The M1 chip had a total of 8 cores (6 performance and 2 efficiency) and the
laptop had 16GB of RAM. Before running the benchmark effort was made to turn off
connectivity and close a reasonable number of idle applications. Furthermore,
all benchmarks were run in one sitting and therefore subject to a similar
environment with no interventions; left only to the natural fluctuations in idle
computation and external factors such as temperature.

The code was compiled using GHC 9.2.7 with the \verb|O1| optimisation flag.
Execution and compilation was managed by Cabal 3.6.2.0.
