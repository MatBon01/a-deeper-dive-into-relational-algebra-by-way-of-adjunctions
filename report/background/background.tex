In this chapter we will first introduce the mathematical concepts used in the construction of relational algebra in \cite{RelationalAlgebraByWayOfAdjunctions} as discrete topics in order to introduce some intuition and context. We will then use all that we covered to explore the evolution of the mathematical descriptions of database systems. Finally, an overview of other academic research used in this project's contributed will be presented.
