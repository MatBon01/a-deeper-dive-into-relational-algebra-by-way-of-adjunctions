\section{Category theory}
Category theory will be our main tool in describing the mathematical structure of different elements of our database systems, and relations between them. More generally, category theory can be seen as a way of taking the abstractions that algebra was built on to a higher level, an ``abstraction of abstractions''. You can find that just as easily as categories can help us in our domain, categories have a rich language and can describe many structures in mathematics ranging from groups and rings to matrices.
