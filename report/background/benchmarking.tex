\section{Benchmarking databases}
Databases are pervasive to modern society and thus standards have arisen over
the last few decades to ensure that customers are able to pick their preferred
DBMS vendor.

At the top level, database benchmarks are classified into three categories: industry-standard, vendor and
customer-application \cite{PractitionersIntroduction}. 
These classifications are usually motivated by intention of the benchmark
instead of structure of the database management system; there is no shortage of
papers emphasising the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for applications
\cite{PractitionersIntroduction, BenchmarkHandbook} and depending on the
risk/performance tolerance of the application it may be necessary to consider
results from all three categories.

\paragraph{Vendor benchmark} A vendor database benchmark is used by
the database vendor during the production of the database management system.
This benchmark usually serves multiple purposes not just limited to the design
of the system. Of course, it is often used to highlight any performance
bottlenecks driving the design of the system internally but it usually doubles
up and acts as the knowledge base for the marketing of the system. Vendor
benchmarks are usually characterised by a more comprehensive suite of
tests to generate the insights capable of driving the direction of the
product \cite{PractitionersIntroduction}.

\paragraph{Industry-standard benchmark} An industry-standard benchmark is a set
benchmarking suite designed independently to any vendor or solution. It is
designed to allow for a fair comparison between different vendors and has been
shown to increase competition between vendors \cite{Wisconsin2}. As much of
this review will show, many industry-standard benchmarks have been developed
to give results for a wide range of applications of databases for much more
relevant and specialised results; and, although many benchmarks have similar
metrics \cite{SetQueryBenchmark, DebitCredit}, just selecting what metrics to
show consumers is not a trivial task \cite{DebitCredit}. When Gray's paper
\cite{BenchmarkHandbook} was written, it was noted that these benchmarks were
becoming so popular that vendors were also beginning to report their results
with their marketing.

\paragraph{Consumer-application benchmark} This type of benchmark refers to any
benchmarking that a customer would run, typically to choose between different
vendors for their application. This kind of testing can be critical for a
performance-sensitive application \cite{PractitionersIntroduction} and is often
done to test the performance of the database under a specific installation
profile \cite{DoingYourOwnBenchmark} or loads. This is a very specialised
requirements based benchmarking.

The review now turns to different domain-specific benchmarking of databases in
order to comment on and analyse any common structures found when designing
databases. This will help inform major design decisions of this project when
deciding what aspects to include in the benchmarking of the alternative join
syntax.

Despite the innumerable use cases for databases in the modern world, many
applications require and prioritise similar values when choosing a solution.
Furthermore, as most industrial-standard database benchmarks have been designed in
order to allow comparison for specific domain requirements, you will commonly
find database benchmarks that are designed with one of two different
applications in mind: \emph{transaction processing} or \emph{decision support}
\cite{PractitionersIntroduction}; it is worth mentioning that other application
types exist, however, such as \emph{document search} and \emph{direct marketing}
\cite{SetQueryBenchmark}. The application types of transaction processing and
decision support are so pervasive that they are commonly also used to partition
other application types, for instance OLTP (Online transaction processing) and
OLAP (Online analytical processing) are specialised for online processing but
share many comparative similarities as transaction processing and decision
support respectively \cite{OLTP-Oracle}.

This review will provide a brief overview of both
the main database application types, then focus more strongly on decision
support benchmarks as ad-hoc query processing is more heavily tested in these
benchmarks and thus more relevant to the project.

\subsection{Transaction processing}
Transaction processing is characterised by a large number of
update-intensive database services with a particular emphasis on integrity of
its requests \cite{PractitionersIntroduction}.
It is clear that this type of environment
demands an emphasis on throughput and integrity. For instance, a bank would
likely have an online transaction processing system in place and the
ability to deal with a large number of transactions in a short period of
time while maintaining the accuracy of the information is most likely paramount.
There are many well known benchmarks to test these types of systems,
including \emph{DebitCredit}, \emph{TPC-C} and \emph{TPC-E} \cite{DebitCredit,
TPC-OLTP}.
These benchmarks usually measure transactions per second or price per
transactions per second. Efforts have been made to try and describe what is
meant by ``price'' and usually it refers to the five-year capital cost (e.g.
cost of hardware, software and system maintenance over a five year period)
\cite{BenchmarkHandbook, DebitCredit}. The advantage of giving a metric
dependent on price is that price is likely to be a limiting of important factor
to most (if not all) organisations when shopping for database solutions and so
it helps encompass all information about the system into a single comparable
number \cite{SetQueryBenchmark}. It is worth noting that many benchmarks which
include this metric also give more information for the user \cite{TPC-H} or
allow the user to weight the comparative importance of features in this metric
\cite{SetQueryBenchmark} but it is expected that much emphasis will come down to
this defining number \cite{SetQueryBenchmark}.

We note that the above definition of a transaction processing system not only
highlights its intense performance requirements but also notes the importance of
integrity. The bank example highlights intuitively what we mean by integrity, a
shop may not want the transaction to go through zero times if it is reported
that it has, in fact, been processed, just as I would not want the transaction
to go through twice. So what exactly is a transaction? And how can we specify
its integrity in a rigorous way?

A transaction simply is an input to the database that must be considered as one
unit of work \cite{ComputerScienceDictionary} and completed independently to any
concurrent actions occurring \cite{ACID}. The integrity of this behaviour can be described 
by a set of properties typically remembered as the acronym \emph{ACID} and
explained below \cite{ACID, PractitionersIntroduction}.

\paragraph{Atomicity} An ``all or nothing'' property of a transaction. All
individual operations must take place or any partially-completed sequence of
operations must have no lasting effects on the data. The user should be informed
of which outcome has occurred.

\paragraph{Consistency} Given the database was in a consistent/valid state
before the transaction processed, it must remain in a consistent/valid state
after any changes are committed; that is to say the changes cause not integrity
constraints to be violated \cite{IntroToDatabaseSystems}. 
Some texts favour the term ``correctness'' \cite{IntroToDatabaseSystems} but this
discussion is outside of the scope of the project. 
% correctness vs consistency: correctness may be preferred as it is stronger, 
% and says that the database only contains true statements about the world

\paragraph{Isolation} Information related to the execution of one transaction
should be hidden from other transactions running concurrently. This is
equivalent to being able to find an order such that the results of the execution
of all transactions would be the same if they were executed sequentially in that
order.

\paragraph{Durability} Once a transaction has been successfully completed, its
effects must persist and future malfunctions.

\subsection{Decision support}
Decision support is characterised by the need to execute complicated queries on
a database with fewer changes \cite{IntroToDatabaseSystems,
PractitionersIntroduction}. The business value from this sort of application are
vast, especially in automatic report generation to produce insights and direct
company strategy \cite{SetQueryBenchmark, IntroToDatabaseSystems}. Despite the
clear business needs, the measurements usually taken by decision support
benchmarks are not as standard as those by transaction processing benchmarks and
metrics usually vary according to benchmark 
\cite{PractitionersIntroduction}; some common metrics collected are a measure of
elapsed time \cite{Wisconsin, TPC-H, PractitionersIntroduction}, performance of
the underlying system (CPU and I/O utilisation) \cite{PractitionersIntroduction}
and the throughput or price per throughput \cite{TPC-H, SetQueryBenchmark,
PractitionersIntroduction} (as in transaction support systems). 

Although less pervaisive in our every day life to transaction support systems,
there are a large number of benchmarks for decision support systems. To name a
few there are the \emph{Wisconsin benchmark} \cite{Wisconsin}, \emph{Bull Single-User Decision
Support benchmark (SUDS)} \cite{PractitionersIntroduction}, \emph{Set Query
benchmark} \cite{SetQueryBenchmark} and \emph{TPC-H} \cite{TPC-H}. 

\subsection{Database benchmarking case studies}
In the section a variety of different benchmarks will be briefly presented and
compared. The reader should note that the list of benchmarks presented is
nowhere near exhaustive and are chosen specifically sample. Although the effort
for representation has been made, the benchmarks also were not chosen to be
representative of the large academic field; it must be noted that benchmarking
databases usually tests a lot more than is relevant to this project and so none
should be completely relevant. The decisions on which benchmarks to include in
this section were made on the following criteria:
\subparagraph{Historical importance}\label{enum:historicalImportance} I believe that the largest benefit of this
literature review to the project is identifying the steps that benchmarks have
taken to approach the empirically based and approximated rigorous approach they
are today in order to inform design decisions throughout the project. Therefore,
rather than just basing the decision on recency, I believe it more beneficial
considering papers of more historical importance in order to present an
intuition on key values within benchmarking databases instead of following a
clear and inexpressive specification that could lead to designs that obfuscate
the (specific) results the project deems important. 
\subparagraph{Relevance} Relevance to the project at hand is extremely
important. There are many defining features of the projects such as a query
based, join heavy theory and therefore benchmarks with specific abilities to
answer questions favouring these features were chosen (clearly leaning towards
decision support benchmarks).
\subparagraph{Recency} The recency of the benchmark was taken into consideration
when comparing to others, however was not a deciding factor. At times, if there
were multiple similar benchmarks without historical importance (especially if
it has been made clear that some benchmarks have been deprecated) the most
recent benchmark was chosen. This was to try and consider the most up to date
practices when exploring this field.

\subsubsection{Wisconsin}
In Bitton's paper, ``Benchmarking Database Systems - A Systematic Approach''
\cite{Wisconsin} she presents the \emph{Wisconsin benchmark} alongside a
comparison of a few major database systems at the time. She claimed that her
custom database and queries represented a ``first attempt in developing a
scientific methodology for performance evaluation of a database management
system'' and claimed that previous evaluation studies of database machines were
``based on simplified analytical models''.

This literature review is focused only on the benchmarking methodology and
largely ignores any results obtained by Bitton for the now clearly outdated
database machines. From my perspective, her main contribution to the field was
the idea to construct a synthetic database for the database which has
subsequently been used in almost all benchmarks since, with the Set Query
Benchmark specifically pointing out this contribution in its acknowledgements
\cite{SetQueryBenchmark}. 

Bitton reflects on the issues of using empirical
databases for benchmarking observing that not only would you require a large
sample size before they could be considered randomly distributed; furthermore
for a benchmark empirical databases are difficult to scale and make it difficult
to specify the selectivity of the operations being benchmarked. Selectivity has
been used loosely here to refer to any operation that acts on a subset of
the tuples; as Bitton explains, it is difficult to construct a selection query that
selects a tenth of the database (i.e. a selection query with an \emph{selectivity
factor} of 10\%) or only keeps 1000 tuples in an empirical database. Bitton
notes that modelling selectivity factors on queries with joins is especially
difficult (a key part of our problem domain). 

Another benefit of using a synthetic database is, given that it is designed
well, it should be more readable. The Wisconsin benchmark boasts relations and
attributes with names that immediately give you an idea of what you would find
and the distribution of its values. In Jim Gray's later work
\cite{BenchmarkHandbook}, he specifically calls out simplicity as one of four
key properties of a domain-specific benchmark - defining it as a database's
understandability and commenting that without it the database would lack
credibility.

\paragraph{The relations} This section contains a description of the relations in
the database system and a brief description of their use. The database consists
of 4 relations, namely ``\relation{thoustup}'', ``\relation{twothoustup}'',
``\relation{fivethoustup}'', and ``\relation{tenthoustup}'' with 1000, 2000, 5000
and 10000 tuples respectively; where it is
clear that the relations are named after it's cardinality (the number of tuples
it contains \cite{PractitionersIntroduction}). It is worth noting that multiple
relations are generated for use in 
queries with multiple operands (such as a join), producing in practice
``tenthoustupA'' and ``tenthoustupB'' for instance. The advantage to this explicit
naming is as above, any implementer knows exactly what relation they are dealing
with making the benchmark a much more readable endeavour. Furthermore, as you will
see later, it is paramount to calculating selectivity factors.

\paragraph{The tuples} Each relation has 16 attributes, designed such that a
tuple is exactly 182 bytes long in order to make the size of all four relations
approximately 4MB, according to Bitton. These attributes can be found in
\fref{tab:WisconsinAttributes} and are comprised of 2 key-like unique integer
attributes, 12 cyclic integer attributes with varying domains and 3 string attributes.

    \caption{The attributes of a relation with cardinality $K$ in the Wisconsin
    database for benchmarking \cite{PractitionersIntroduction, Wisconsin}}
    \label{tab:WisconsinAttributes}
\end{table}

\subparagraph{Unique integer attributes} The unique attributes, names \attribute{unique1} and
\attribute{unique2} are integer fields that range from $0$ to $K - 1$ where $K$
is the cardinality (number of tuples) of the relation. \emph{Both} fields are
randomly generated (as is emphasised in Bitton's reflective paper
\cite{Wisconsin2}) but it is noted that \attribute{unique2} is usually used to
sort the relation. As the name suggests, both fields are unique. 

\subparagraph{Cyclic integer attributes} These names of these attributes are
named after the number of values they can take and any properties; for instance
``\attribute{four}'' can take 4 values from 0 to 3, and ``\attribute{even100}''
can take any even number between 0 and 99 (the first 100 numbers counting from
0). Despite following a uniform distribution in Bitton's original paper, these
integers have been dubbed cyclic as they are designed to be non-unique and some
implementations \cite{PractitionersIntroduction} derive their value from a
modulo operation on \attribute{unique1}. These attributes are key to the
advantages of using a synthetic database as, given the relation cardinality, you
can use it to specify any number of selectivity factors. For instance a
selection operation on \attribute{two} relation would result in a selectivity
factor of 50\%. 

\subparagraph{String attributes} The database has three string attributes, all
of which contain 52 characters. Two of these attributes, \attribute{stringu1}
and \attribute{stringu2} are derivative on other randomly generated attributes
in the relation, namely \attribute{unique1} and \attribute{unique2}
respectively. Whereas the final string attributes \attribute{string4} cycles
through four variations of a string. It is noted that all strings have names
that help the reader understand their origins, with the first two containing
``u1'' or ``u2'' denoting what component the value would be derived from and the
``4'' in \attribute{string4} denoting the cardinality of its domain. Each string follows
the template outlined in \fref{fig:WisconsinStringTemplate}; each \$ is to be
replaced with a letter between A and V inclusive (the \emph{significant
letters}) and x denotes the character literal
`x'. As each of the \$ can be replaced independently with 22 different
letters, the template can produce $22^3 = 10,648$ unique strings. The design
intention for this string was twofold, firstly it is clear how the template
could easily be expanded to allow for more significant letters but less
obviously, the spacings of the significant letters were meant to help change the
CPU load by changing the CPU time needed to compare two strings.

Both \attribute{stringu1} and \attribute{stringu2} are derived from
\attribute{unique1} and \attribute{unique2} in the same way. The string
corresponding to 0 is \WisconsinStringStructure{A}{A}{A} and to find the
subsequent string, the leftmost character is `increased' and once it reaches `V',
the next character increased (in the same way) and the current character is
reset to `A`. This can be seen counting in base 22 with the least significant
digit on the left instead of the right. An example can be found in
\fref{fig:WisconsinUniqueStringExample}.
