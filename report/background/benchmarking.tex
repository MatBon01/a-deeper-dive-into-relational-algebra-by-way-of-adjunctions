\section{Benchmarking databases}
Databases are pervasive to modern society and thus standards have arisen over
the last few decades to ensure that customers are able to pick their preferred
DBMS vendor.

At the top level, database benchmarks are usually split into three different
categories: industry-standard, vendor and
customer-application \cite{PractitionersIntroduction}. Each type of benchmark
usually is driven by a different goal and thus are all important to the creation
of a DBMS. Briefly, a vendor database benchmark is usually used during the
development of a DBMS by the vendor themselves to aid
the general development of the solution and sales; it is usually characterised
by a more comprehensive suite of tests driven by insights into the internals. An
industry-standard is usually characterised by independent testing of the
database for comparisons across vendors. Finally, a customer-application test is
a test that an organisation should design and run before choosing a specific
vendor, choosing to test specific requirements and emphases related to their
business domain.


The type of benchmark to run also largely depends on the use-case for the
database. Typically we can refer to the use cases as \emph{transaction
processing} or \emph{decision support} \cite{PractitionersIntroduction}.
